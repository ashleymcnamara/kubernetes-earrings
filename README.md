# Kubernetes Earrings 💙❤️

A 3D-printable accessory set inspired by the Kubernetes logo with a bit of open source heart.

This project includes **two separate earring designs**:

1. **Pixel Heart Dangle Earrings** – A layered design featuring the Kubernetes ship wheel on top and a pixelated red heart dangling below. 
2. **Plain Kubernetes Logo Earrings (or Keychain)** – Just the Kubernetes logo with a top hole, great as a minimalist earring—or repurpose it as a keychain or zipper pull if jewelry isn't your thing.

## What's Included

Designed in **Fusion 360**, this repo includes:

- `k8s_heart_earring.stl` – Combined earring: Kubernetes logo with pixelated heart attached  
- `k8s_plain_earring.stl` – Standalone Kubernetes logo earring/keychain  
- `k8s_top.stl` – Kubernetes logo piece with top and bottom holes  
- `pixel_heart.stl` – Pixel-style heart with white highlights  
- `.3mf` files for all of the above (for better color and layer control)
